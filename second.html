    <p id="second">The Jonas Brothers made the comeback we've been waiting for! The upbeat song plays along with the concept of a lovestruck man who can't get enough of his lover. As a matter-of-fact, the music video for "Sucker" also includes the band members's real-life lovers (how adorable, isn't it?).</p>
